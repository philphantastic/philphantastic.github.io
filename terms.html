<h1>TERMS, CODE OF CONDUCT & PRIVACY POLICIES</h1>

<h2>TERMS OF SERVICE</h2>
<p>Welcome to Peak Soccer ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our soccer training services and related offerings (collectively, the "Services"). By using our Services, you agree to be bound by the following terms.</p>

<h3>1. Eligibility</h3>
<p>You must be at least 18 years old to purchase our Services. If you are under 18, you may use our Services only with the involvement of a parent or legal guardian. Parents/Guardians must be present for the session, you may NOT leave your child unattended.</p>

<h3>2. Registration</h3>
You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.

<h3>3. Soccer Sessions</h3>
Players must participate and have a willingness to improve themselves. Company staff can end a soccer session for lack of player participation at any time.

<h3>4. Payments</h3>
As our soccer curriculum is created based on annual participation, our soccer packages auto-renew monthly. By purchasing a package you consent to monthly recurring billing. Recurring packages can only be canceled 7 days before the next package begins. Unfortunately we are unable to refund packages that are renewed due to lack of planning by customers. Payments must be made 5 business days before the new package will begin. Payment through Stripe is preferred to avoid missing payment deadlines, however Applepay, Venmo, PayPal, and Cash can be accepted. Please reference the specific instructions in your package information email. All fees and charges are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in these Terms or as required by applicable law.

<h3>5. Cancellation and Rescheduling</h3>
In the event of unforeseen weather events or staff illnesses, the company reserves the right to reschedule your scheduled session or extend a credit toward your subsequent package.
We do not routinely provide makeup sessions or rescheduling at the request of clients. However, should the company's schedule permit, you must provide at least 24 hours' notice, and we will make every effort to accommodate your needs. The company is committed to providing the utmost flexibility to our clients, although we cannot guarantee the availability of makeup sessions – no refunds or credits will be issued in such cases. Please note that “make ups” or “credits” are not available for the Unlimited Plan.

<h3>6. Code of Conduct</h3>
You and your child agree to conduct yourselves in a respectful and sportsmanlike manner during all training sessions. Disruptive or disrespectful behavior may result in the termination of your access to our Services. Parents may watch and encourage, but not coach or give specific instructions. The sessions are for the player to be trained by the coach, not by their parents. 
Any violence displayed by parent or player will result in an immediate removal from the program with no refund.
